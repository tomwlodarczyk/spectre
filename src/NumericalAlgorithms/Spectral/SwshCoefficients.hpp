 * \details
 * The CoefficientsMetadata class acts as a memory-safe container for a
 * `sharp_alm_info*`, required for use of libsharp transform utilities.
 * The libsharp utilities are currently constructed to only provide user
 * functions with collocation data for spin-weighted functions and
 * derivatives.  This class also provides an iterator for
 * easily traversing a libsharp-compatible modal representation.
 *
 * \note The libsharp representation of coefficients is altered from the
 * standard mathematical definitions in a nontrivial way. There are a number of
 * important features to the data storage of the coefficients.
 * - they are stored as a set of complex values, but each vector of complex
 *   values is the transform of only the real or imaginary part of the
 *   collocation data
 * - because each vector of complex coefficients is related to the transform of
 *   a set of doubles, only (about) half of the m's are stored (m >= 0), because
 *   the remaining m modes are determinable by conjugation from the positive m
 *   modes, given that they represent the transform of a purely real or purely
 *   imaginary collocation quantity
 * - they are stored in an l-varies-fastest, triangular representation. To be
 *   concrete, for an l_max=2, the order of coefficient storage is (l, m):
 *   [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
 * - due to the restriction of representing only the transform of real
 *   quantities, the m=0 modes always have vanishing imaginary component.
