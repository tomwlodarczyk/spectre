IWYU is still not yet fully mature and  provides incorrect suggestions\n\
sometimes. Known problematic cases are:\n\
- Removing headers required for explicit instantiations. Consider a function\n\
  that takes an Index<Dim> as its only argument. You can instantiate it for\n\
  various dimensions, say up to Dim=4, quite easily in a cpp file. Thus, the\n\
  header only has a forward declaration and the function definition and\n\
  instantiations are in the cpp file. IWYU will tell you that you do not\n\
  need to include DataStructures/Index.hpp in the cpp file, which is\n\
  incorrect. You can tell IWYU that it is wrong and you must include the\n\
  header file by including it as:\n
  #include \"DataStructures/Index.hpp\"  // IWYU pragma: keep\n\
- Class template declarations with default template parameters are not\n\
  handled correctly. See issue #530 on IWYU GitHub. Specifically, say you\n\
  have a header TagsDeclarations.hpp that declares\n\
  'template <size_t Dim, class Frame = Frame::Inertial> MyTag;' and another\n\
  header file Tags.hpp that defines the class. Then it suffices and is\n\
  optimal to include TagsDeclarations.hpp in other header files that do not\n\
  need the definition of the Tags. However, IWYU will tell you to provide the\n\
  forward declaration with the defaulted template parameters in the header\n\
  file that you'd include TagsDeclarations.hpp in. This means you are\n\
  including the default template parameters in more than one place, which is\n'
  not allowed.\n\
  There are two ways to deal with this issue:\n\
  - Use // IWYU pragma: no_forward_declare MyTag\n\
  - Have the associated cpp file to not be checked by TravisCI by adding it\n\
    to the whitelist in $SPECTRE_HOME/.travis/RunIncludeWhatYouUse.sh AFTER\n\
    having corrected all valid suggestions. You can run IWYU from the Docker\n\
    container to test locally.\n\
