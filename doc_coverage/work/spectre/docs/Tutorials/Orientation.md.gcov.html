<span class="lineNum">       8 </span>            : Each element in a domain has a set of internal directions which it uses
<span class="lineNum">       9 </span>            : for computations in its own local coordinate system. These are referred to
<span class="lineNum">      10 </span>            : as the logical directions \f$\xi\f$, \f$\eta\f$, and \f$\zeta\f$, where
<span class="lineNum">      11 </span>            : \f$\xi\f$ is the first dimension, \f$\eta\f$ is the second dimension, and
<span class="lineNum">      12 </span>            : \f$\zeta\f$ is the third dimension. In a
<span class="lineNum">      13 </span>            : domain with multiple elements, the logical directions are not necessarily
<span class="lineNum">      14 </span>            : aligned on the interfaces between two elements, as shown in the figure below.
<span class="lineNum">      15 </span>            : As certain operations (e.g. fluxes, limiting) communicate information across
<span class="lineNum">      16 </span>            : the boundaries of adjacent elements, there needs to be a class that takes
<span class="lineNum">      17 </span>            : into account the relative orientations of elements which neighbor each other.
<span class="lineNum">      18 </span>            : This class is OrientationMap.

<span class="lineNum">      21 </span>            : Each Block in a Domain has a set of BlockNeighbors, which each hold an
<span class="lineNum">      22 </span>            : OrientationMap. In this scenario, the Block is referred to as the host, and

<span class="lineNum">      29 </span>            : 
<span class="lineNum">      30 </span>            : In the image above, we see a domain decomposition into two Blocks, which have
<span class="lineNum">      31 </span>            : their logical axes rotated relative to one another. With the left block as
<span class="lineNum">      32 </span>            : the host Block, we see that it has a neighbor in the \f$+\xi\f$ direction.
<span class="lineNum">      33 </span>            : The host Block holds a `std::unordered_map` from Directions to BlockNeighbors;
<span class="lineNum">      34 </span>            : the BlockNeighbor itself holds an OrientationMap that determines the mapping
<span class="lineNum">      35 </span>            : from each logical direction in the host Block to that in the neighboring Block.
<span class="lineNum">      36 </span>            : That is, the OrientationMap takes as input local information (i.e. logical
<span class="lineNum">      37 </span>            : directions in the host's coordinate system) and returns neighbor information
<span class="lineNum">      38 </span>            : (i.e. logical directions in the neighbor's coordinate system). An
<span class="lineNum">      39 </span>            : OrientationMap is constructed by passing in the block neighbor directions that
<span class="lineNum">      40 </span>            : correspond to the \f$+\xi\f$, \f$+\eta\f$, \f$+\zeta\f$ directions in the host.
<span class="lineNum">      41 </span>            : In this case, these directions in the host map to the \f$+\zeta\f$,
<span class="lineNum">      42 </span>            : \f$+\xi\f$, \f$+\eta\f$ directions in the neighbor, respectively.
<span class="lineNum">      43 </span>            : This BlockNeighbor thus holds the OrientationMap constructed with the list
<span class="lineNum">      44 </span>            : (\f$+\zeta\f$, \f$+\xi\f$, \f$+\eta\f$). With the right block as the host
<span class="lineNum">      45 </span>            : block, we see that it has a BlockNeighbor in the \f$-\zeta\f$ direction, and
<span class="lineNum">      46 </span>            : the OrientationMap held by this BlockNeighbor is the one constructed with the
<span class="lineNum">      47 </span>            : array (\f$+\eta\f$, \f$+\zeta\f$, \f$+\xi\f$). For convenience, OrientationMap
<span class="lineNum">      48 </span>            : has a method `inverse_map` which returns the OrientationMap that takes as input
<span class="lineNum">      49 </span>            : neighbor information and returns local information.

<span class="lineNum">      54 </span>            : to this problem is the corner numbering scheme.

<span class="lineNum">      57 </span>            : The orientation of the \f${dim}\f$ logical directions within each element

<span class="lineNum">      83 </span>            : shared among them, so there are only twelve unique corners in this domain.
<span class="lineNum">      84 </span>            : Any numbering may be used in the global corner numbering, so long as the

<span class="lineNum">      97 </span>            : and the elements of the set determined by how one assigned the Global CNS to
<span class="lineNum">      98 </span>            : the Domain. For the image above, the Subset CNS corresponding to the left block
<span class="lineNum">      99 </span>            : is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10}, while the Subset CNS corresponding to the right
<span class="lineNum">     100 </span>            : block is {1, 4, 7, 10, 2, 5, 8, 11}. This ordering of the Subset CNS encodes
<span class="lineNum">     101 </span>            : the relative orientations between each Block. Subset CNSs need to be provided
<span class="lineNum">     102 </span>            : for each Block in a Domain. It turns out that for very regular domains,
<span class="lineNum">     103 </span>            : (i.e. spherical or rectilinear) we can generate the appropriate Subset CNSs.

<span class="lineNum">     221 </span>            : identifies corners and edges with each other as opposed to simply faces. This
<span class="lineNum">     222 </span>            : allows the user to specify more peculiar boundary conditions. For example,
