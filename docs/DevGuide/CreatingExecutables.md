# Creating Executables {#dev_guide_creating_executables}

There are several different types of executables that can be built:
- An executable that uses Charm++ to run in parallel,
  e.g. `Executables/ParallelInfo`
- An executable that does not use Charm++, does not run in parallel, and
  supplies its own `main`, e.g. `Executables/Benchmark`
- An executable that uses Charm++ to run in parallel but supplies its own `main`
- An executable that uses custom compilation or linking flags,
  e.g. `DebugPreprocessor`
- Executables used for evolutions or elliptic solves

### Executable Using Charm++ for Parallelization

A simple example of an executable using Charm++ for parallelization is in
`src/Executables/Examples/HelloWorld`. To add an executable as a target, use
the CMake function `add_spectre_parallel_executable` which takes as its four
arguments
- the name of the executable
- the name of the path relative to src that contains the header file (which is
  the name of the executable with extension `.hpp`) that will define structs and
  functions to be described below
- the name of the metavariables struct described below
- the list of SpECTRE libraries needed for the executable to link

For example,

```
set(LIBS_TO_LINK
  Informer
  Utilities
  )

add_spectre_parallel_executable(
  SingletonHelloWorld
  Executables/Examples/HelloWorld
  Metavars
  "${LIBS_TO_LINK}"
  )
```
will create the executable `SingletonHelloWorld` from
SingletonHelloWorld.hpp which is found in the directory
`src/Executables/Examples/HelloWorld`.  `Metavars` will be used as the
metavariables struct, and `SingletonHelloWorld` will link against the
`%Informer` and `Utilities` SpECTRE libraries.

The header file from which an executable is generated must define a
metavariables struct that can be thought of as a compile-time input file that
defines what the executable will do.  The `Metavars` struct for
`SingletonHelloWorld` is a minimal example of a metavariables struct.

\snippet SingletonHelloWorld.hpp executable_example_metavariables

Each metavariables must define an enum class `Phase` with the phases of the
executable (which must include `Initialization` and `Exit`), and a static
function `determine_next_phase`.  In the example, the only additional phase is
`Execute`, and the phases are executed in order.  Charm++ will execute each
phase until it detects that nothing is happening (quiescence detection).  As
this represents a global synchronization point, the number of phases should be
minimized in order to exploit the power of SpECTRE.

Each metavariables must define a type alias `component_list` that is a
`tmpl::list` of the parallel components used by the executable.
`SingletonHelloWorld` defines a single component `HelloWorld`

\snippet SingletonHelloWorld.hpp executable_example_singleton

which specifies via the `chare_type` type alias that it is a singleton parallel
component which means that only one such object will exist across all processors
used by the executable.  Each component must define the static functions
`initialize`, which is executed during the `Initialization` phase, and
`execute_next_phase` which is executed during the phases (other than
`Initialization` and `Exit`) defined in the metavariables struct.  In
`SingletonHelloWorld`, nothing is done during the initialization phase, while
the `PrintMessage` action is called during the `Execute` phase.

\snippet  SingletonHelloWorld.hpp executable_example_action

The `PrintMessage` action is executed on whatever process the singleton
component is created upon, and prints a message.

Executables can read in an input file (specified by the `--input-file`
argument) that will be parsed when the executable begins.  %Options
specified in the input file can be used to either place items in the
Parallel::ConstGlobalCache (by specifying tags in the
`const_global_cache_tags` type alias of the metavariables, component
and action structs), to construct items in the db::DataBox of
components during initialization (by specifying tags in the
`initialization_tags` type alias of action struct), or be passed to
the `allocate_array` function of an array component (by specifying
tags in the `allocation_tags` type alias of the component).
`SingletonHelloWorld` specifies a single option

\snippet SingletonHelloWorld.hpp executable_example_options

which a string specifying a name that will be placed into the constant global
cache.  The string is fetched when performing the `PrintMessage` action. Items
in the constant global cache are stored once per node that the executable runs
on. An example input file for `SingletonHelloWorld` can be found in
`tests/InputFiles/ExampleExecutables/SingletonHelloWorld.yaml` and shows how to
specify the options (lines beginning with a `#` are comments and can be
ignored).

In addition to defining the metavaribles and component structs, the header for
an executable must define two lists of functions

\snippet  SingletonHelloWorld.hpp executable_example_charm_init

that are executed at startup by Charm++ on each node and processor the
executable runs on.

Furthermore among the included header files

\snippet  SingletonHelloWorld.hpp executable_example_includes

must be the appropriate header for each parallel component type, which in the
`SingletonHelloWorld` example is `AlgorithmSingleton.hpp`.  Note that
these headers are not in the source tree, but are generated automatically when
the code is compiled.

See [the Parallelization documentation](group__ParallelGroup.html#details)
for more details.

### Executable Using Charm++ with Custom main()

While this is technically possible, it has not been tested. We recommend using
the Charm++ supplied main chare mechanism for the time being.

### Executable Not Using Charm++

An example of an executable that does not use Charm++ for parallelization but
still can use all other infrastructure in SpECTRE is in
`src/Executables/Examples/HelloWorldNoCharm`. Adding a non-Charm++ executable to
SpECTRE mostly follows the standard way of adding an executable using CMake. The
only deviation is that the `CMakeLists.txt` file must tell Charm++ not to add a
`main()` by passing the link flags `-nomain-module -nomain`. This is done using
CMake's `set_target_properties`:

```
set_target_properties(
  ${EXECUTABLE}
  PROPERTIES LINK_FLAGS "-nomain-module -nomain"
  )
```

To add the executable as a target you must use the `add_spectre_executable`
function, which is a light weight wrapper around CMake's `add_executable`.
For example,

```
add_spectre_executable(
  ${EXECUTABLE}
  EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL # Exclude from calls to `make` without a specified target
  HelloWorld.cpp
  )
```

You can link in any of the SpECTRE libraries by adding them to the
`target_link_libraries`, for example:

```
target_link_libraries(
  ${EXECUTABLE}
  DataStructures
  )
```

We recommend that you add a test that the executable properly runs by adding an
input file to `tests/InputFiles` in an appropriate subdirectory. See
[`tests/InputFiles/ExampleExecutables/HelloWorldNoCharm.yaml`]
(https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre/tree/develop/tests/InputFiles/
ExampleExecutables/HelloWorldNoCharm.yaml)
for an example.
The input file is passed to the executable using `--input-file
path/to/Input.yaml`. In the case of the executable not taking any input file
this is just used to generate a test that runs the executable.

For these types of executables `main` can take the usual `(int argc, char
*argv[])` and parse command line options. Executables not using Charm++ are just
standard executables that can link in any of the libraries in SpECTRE.

\warning
Currently calling `Parallel::abort` results in a segfault deep inside Charm++
code. However, the error messages from `ASSERT` and `ERROR` are still printed.

### Executable With Custom Compilation or Linking Flags

Use the CMake function `set_target_properties` to add flags to an executable. To
call a completely custom compiler invocation you should use the
`add_custom_target` CMake function. The need for the `custom_target` level of
control is rare and should generally be avoided since it adds quite a bit of
technical debt to the code base. Thus, it is not explained here. If you are
certain you need it you can see the `DebugPreprocessor` executable's
`CMakeLists.txt` file for an example.

### Executable Used for Evolution or Elliptic Solve

Once they are written, see the tutorials specific to evolution and elliptic
solves.
